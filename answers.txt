1. Question 1
-  In the browser, we see a black rectangular area which has an image of a rabbit inside it. This image can be moved around in the black area with a drag action. If the image is clicked, it turns to red. If another tab is opened and we perform a click/drag action, we can see that the image has been moved in the previous tab as well.

-  TypeScript is an Object-oriented programming language, whereas JavaScript is a prototype based language.
-  TypeScript has a feature known as Static typing but JavaScript does not.
-  TypeScript supports interfaces but JavaScript does not.

3. Question 3
-  A bundler is a development tool that combines many JavaScript code files into one that is production-ready loadable in the browser.

-  When you use a file type that isn't included by default, Parcel will automatically install all of the necessary plugins and dev dependencies for you.
